            <h3>Never Ending Footsteps</h3>
            <p>Many people have asked me why I travel, how I do it, when’s the best time to start traveling, and how to
                start traveling. Honestly, these questions are usually difficult for me to answer, because everyone has
                different ways of preparing for their travels. Plus, everyone has different reasons why they want to
                travel.
                If you ask me, the advice I’ll give to you would be something I’d give to a younger me.</p>
            <p>Before I knew how much I love to travel, I did all the things my family wanted me to do. <strong>Study.
                    Graduate. Work</strong>. I did all of them with no regrets. College was one of the best things that
                happened to me.</p>

                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
